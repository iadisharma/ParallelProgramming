# ParallelProgramming
CS1666 Parallel Programming Lab

Objective: The outcome of the lab classes must lead to a skilled and self-sustained program developer.

Pre-requisites: Concepts of Data Structures and Sorting Algorithms, Mutliprocessor, Multiprogramming architectures and their functioning.

Course Outcome: On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Classify the different parallel programming constructs.
2. Simulate various parallel programming constructs in any high level language.
3. Select appropriate constructs to be used in different algorithms.
4. Justify the output of a program in solving different problems and evaluate its performance and effectiveness.
5. Compare the performance of programs designed on two different paradigms.
